HLX Performance Example - Inserting 100,000 documents
============================================================
This example demonstrates HLX performance by:
  • Creating 100,000 test documents
  • Inserting them in batches of 1,000
  • Measuring insertion and search performance
  • Comparing memory vs file-based storage
  • Testing file storage with synchronous=off for maximum speed

Usage: go run performance.go -tags fts5

============================================================
Performance comparison completed!

📋 Summary:
  • Memory database: Fastest, but not persistent
  • File database: Safe and persistent, moderate speed
  • File database (Fast Mode): Maximum speed with synchronous=OFF

⚠️  WARNING: synchronous=OFF trades safety for speed!
   Data may be lost if the system crashes before writes are flushed to disk.
